# Hi, I'm JesÃºs Moncada-RamÃ­rez ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Computer and Mechatronics Engineer** and current **Research Associate** at the [Machine Perception and Intelligent Robotics (MAPIR) group](https://mapir.isa.uma.es/), University of MÃ¡laga. My work focuses on studying and developing **Computer Vision** and **Artificial Intelligence** methods to enhance the cognitive capabilities of mobile robots. 

I combine solid academic training with practical software engineering experience.  
My background includes:
- **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering** (Univ. of MÃ¡laga, 2024).
- Erasmus stay at **University of Padua, Italy**, specializing in Computer Vision, Robotics, and Natural Language Processing.  
- **Masterâ€™s in Mechatronics Engineering** (Univ. of MÃ¡laga, 2025).
- Fluent in **Spanish**, **English**, and **Italian**.

I am passionate about **robotics research**, **backend development**, and integrating AI technologies into real-world applications.

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects

### During my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering (*IngenierÃ­a InformÃ¡tica*) at University of MÃ¡laga
- [PCGuesser](https://github.com/Aaronre3/g3-PCGuesser/tree/master)

### During my Erasmus stay at the University of Padua, Italy
- [ImageColouring](https://github.com/AlejandroCCaldero/ImageColouring) â€“ Final project for the *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* course.  
  A conditional GAN project using **U-Net** and **PatchGAN** to recolor grayscale images.  
  It leverages **LPIPS perceptual loss** and a **WGAN discriminator with gradient penalty** to boost color realism and maintain stable training, achieving visually convincing results on a toy dataset.  
  This work deepened my understanding of **deep learning architectures, loss functions, and training stability techniques**.

- TIAGO pick-place
- MÃ¡laga bus graph

### During my research in MAPIR-UMA
- [LLM Robotics Reflection](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/llm-robotics-reflection)
