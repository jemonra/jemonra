## ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects

### During my Erasmus stay at the University of Padua, Italy

- [ImageColouring](https://github.com/AlejandroCCaldero/ImageColouring) (2023) â€“ Final project for the *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* course. A conditional GAN project using U-Net and PatchGAN to recolor grayscale images. It leverages LPIPS perceptual loss and a WGAN discriminator with gradient penalty to boost color realism and maintain stable training, achieving visually convincing results on a toy dataset. This work deepened my understanding of deep learning architectures, loss functions, and training stability techniques.

- [tiago-pick-place-ir](https://github.com/jemonra/tiago-pick-place-ir) (2023) â€“ Final project for the *Intelligent Robotics* course. Developed a set of ROS 2 nodes to perform a complete pick-and-place task with a simulated TIAGo mobile manipulator. The system navigates through the room, reaches designated locations, and controls the robot arm to grasp and place objects from a table, integrating navigation, perception, and manipulation in a single pipeline. This project strengthened my skills in ROS 2 development, robot motion planning, and the integration of navigation and manipulation tasks in mobile robotics.

- [malaga-bus-graph](https://github.com/jemonra/malaga-bus-graph) (2023) â€“ Final project for the *Learning from Networks* course. Conducted a graph-based analysis of MÃ¡lagaâ€™s public bus transport system to study frequency, speed, and node centralities. Built a large, directed multi-graph of bus lines, stops, routes, and timetables, then applied closeness and betweenness centrality metrics and compared them with random graph models to assess significance. This project enhanced my understanding of network analysis, graph algorithms, and their practical application to real-world transportation data.

### During my research in MAPIR-UMA

- [llm-robotics-reflection](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/llm-robotics-reflection) (2025) â€“ Research project and codebase for the paper *[Agentic Workflows for Improving LLM Reasoning in Robotic Object-Centered Planning](https://doi.org/10.3390/robotics14030024)*, published in *MDPI Robotics*. Provides the dataset, prompts, and Python implementation to evaluate agentic workflowsâ€”Self-Reflection, Multi-Agent Reflection, and LLM Ensembleâ€” for improving Large Language Model reasoning in robotic object-centered planning. Experiments on semantic maps from ScanNet and SceneNN demonstrate significant gains in object retrieval accuracy, strengthening my skills in LLM prompting, agentic workflow design, and advanced AIâ€“robotics integration.

- [generative-topological-maps](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/generative-topological-maps) (2025) â€“ Framework for place segmentation, place categorization, and semantic object-relationship inference in pre-built 3D semantic maps. Developed as my Masterâ€™s Thesis in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of MÃ¡laga, this work introduces a geometricâ€“semantic clustering pipeline and LLM/LVLM methods to create rich semantic-topological maps for mobile robots. Key results were published in the paper *Mobile Robot Place Segmentation and Categorization Using Object Semantics*, presented at the European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR) 2025, and fully detailed in my Masterâ€™s Thesis report. This project deepened my expertise in geometricâ€“semantic mapping, LLM/LVLM integration, and the design of advanced pipelines for robotic reasoning.

- [rol_lm](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/ros_lm) (2025, under active development) â€“ ROS 2 package designed to connect robotic systems with LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) through a simple, unified service. The project provides an accessible way for robots to request text or vision-based reasoning from powerful generative models, making it easier to integrate state-of-the-art AI into real-world robotic applications. Working on this repository strengthened my skills in ROS 2 architecture, service design, and the practical integration of modern AI models within robotic platforms.

- [ScanNet](https://github.com/josematez/ScanNet) (2024, under development) â€“ Utilities to automatically download ScanNet sequences and create ready-to-use ROS1/ROS2 bag files for robotic experiments.

- [SceneNN](https://github.com/josematez/SceneNN) (2024, under development) â€“ Companion utilities for downloading SceneNN dataset sequences and generating ROS-compatible bag files for easy integration in robotics projects.
