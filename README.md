# Hi, I'm JesÃºs Moncada-RamÃ­rez ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Computer and Mechatronics Engineer** and current **Research Associate** at the [Machine Perception and Intelligent Robotics (MAPIR) group](https://mapir.isa.uma.es/), University of MÃ¡laga. My work focuses on studying and developing **Computer Vision** and **Artificial Intelligence** methods to enhance the cognitive capabilities of mobile robots. 

I combine solid academic training with practical software engineering experience.  
My background includes:
- **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering** (Univ. of MÃ¡laga, 2024).
- Erasmus stay at **University of Padua, Italy**, specializing in Computer Vision, Robotics, and Natural Language Processing.  
- **Masterâ€™s in Mechatronics Engineering** (Univ. of MÃ¡laga, 2025).
- Fluent in **Spanish**, **English**, and **Italian**.

I am passionate about **robotics research**, **backend development**, and integrating AI technologies into real-world applications.

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects

### During my Erasmus stay at the University of Padua, Italy

- [ImageColouring](https://github.com/AlejandroCCaldero/ImageColouring) â€“ Final project for the *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* course. A conditional GAN project using U-Net and PatchGAN to recolor grayscale images. It leverages LPIPS perceptual loss and a WGAN discriminator with gradient penalty to boost color realism and maintain stable training, achieving visually convincing results on a toy dataset. This work deepened my understanding of deep learning architectures, loss functions, and training stability techniques.

- [tiago-pick-place-ir](https://github.com/jemonra/tiago-pick-place-ir) â€“ Final project for the *Intelligent Robotics* course. Developed a set of ROS 2 nodes to perform a complete pick-and-place task with a simulated TIAGo mobile manipulator. The system navigates through the room, reaches designated locations, and controls the robot arm to grasp and place objects from a table, integrating navigation, perception, and manipulation in a single pipeline. This project strengthened my skills in ROS 2 development, robot motion planning, and the integration of navigation and manipulation tasks in mobile robotics.

- [malaga-bus-graph](https://github.com/jemonra/malaga-bus-graph) â€“ Final project for the *Learning from Networks* course. Conducted a graph-based analysis of MÃ¡lagaâ€™s public bus transport system to study frequency, speed, and node centralities. Built a large, directed multi-graph of bus lines, stops, routes, and timetables, then applied closeness and betweenness centrality metrics and compared them with random graph models to assess significance. This project enhanced my understanding of network analysis, graph algorithms, and their practical application to real-world transportation data.

### During my research in MAPIR-UMA

- [llm-robotics-reflection](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/llm-robotics-reflection) â€“ Research project and codebase for the paper *[Agentic Workflows for Improving LLM Reasoning in Robotic Object-Centered Planning](https://doi.org/10.3390/robotics14030024)*, published in *MDPI Robotics*. Provides the dataset, prompts, and Python implementation to evaluate agentic workflowsâ€”Self-Reflection, Multi-Agent Reflection, and LLM Ensembleâ€” for improving Large Language Model reasoning in robotic object-centered planning. Experiments on semantic maps from ScanNet and SceneNN demonstrate significant gains in object retrieval accuracy, strengthening my skills in LLM prompting, agentic workflow design, and advanced AIâ€“robotics integration.
